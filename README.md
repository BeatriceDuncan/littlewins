# STRETCH GOALS

🏆 Set up user login & authentication.

🏆 At the end of the week all of the individual littlewins erupt all over the screen like confetti - make a big deal of the entire collection of accomplishments.

🏆 The user can save as PDF or print their week's worth of littlewins.

🏆 👆 Include a slightly corny printable certificate to put on the fridge.

🏆 For long-time users, give the option of seeing last year's entry from the same day.
