      <p>For some folks getting through each day can seem insurmountable. Seemingly small tasks, such as getting out of bed or preparing breakfast, are enormous challenges. Some mental health challenges can be so debilitating that accomplishing the things you need to do in order to help yourself can feel impossible. The task of reading messages from loved ones or contacting a support person can feel unconquerable, which in turn can result in feelings of isolation. Bedtime reflection on a day full of these battles can feel depressing and discouraging, because it’s hard to notice or reconcile what you’ve worked so hard at all day. The challenge and struggle compounds, making the next day even harder to face.</p>
